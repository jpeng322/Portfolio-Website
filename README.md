Bootstrap Information: 

Bootstrap is a web development toolkit and frontend framework created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton. It is a collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that allows for developers to quickly and efficiently develop responsive and mobile-first websites. Some great features of Bootstrap are its responsive grid system, ability to easily resize images based on screen size, and several pre-designed web components. In addition, you can make more efficient and responsive websites by implementing advanced Bootstrap features - like its ability to work in conjunction with Javascript’s JQuery plugins or customizing its CSS file to run more quickly.

Although Bootstrap can save a lot of time and tedious physical effort, it also has some slight flaws. For example, Bootstrap’s syntax may be confusing at first as it has its own 12-column system in determining the width of columns, versus a user being able to customize its own number of columns within its system using vanilla CSS. In addition, Bootstrap may cause an increase in load times for websites as its files are larger than what is normally needed when creating ones own CSS files, reducing efficiency. Lastly, by solely relying on Bootstrap and its collection of premade code and features, the user may find themselves in a cycle of reusing the same code without truly designing their website. This in turn can have a negative effect on their creativity and growth in web development.
